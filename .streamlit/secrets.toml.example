# USER SETTINGS (Chat ID, marking syntax)
# =======================================
# User settings are now stored in URL query parameters.
# Each user bookmarks their personalized URL to save their settings.
# This ensures:
# - Each user has isolated settings (no conflicts)
# - Settings survive app redeployments
# - No server-side storage needed for user preferences
#
# Example URL with user settings:
# https://your-app.streamlit.app/?cid=@yourchannel&syn=%3C%3F%3E

# HOW TO GET TELEGRAPH CREDENTIALS
# ================================
# Option 1: Run this app locally first - it will create an account automatically
# Option 2: Create manually at https://telegra.ph and use their API
#
# The access_token is generated when you create a Telegraph account.
# The index_page_path is the path portion of your glossary index page URL.

# HOW TO GET TELEGRAM BOT TOKEN
# =============================
# 1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
# 2. Send /newbot and follow the prompts
# 3. Copy the bot token provided
